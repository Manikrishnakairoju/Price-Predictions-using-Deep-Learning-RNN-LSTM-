Price Predictions using Deep Learning (RNN-LSTM),USed Yahoo Finance dataset 

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are widely adopted deep learning architectures for price prediction tasks,
especially in financial markets such as stock prices or asset values. These models are specifically designed to handle time series data owing to
their ability to capture dependencies and patterns over time.

Overview of RNN-LSTM for Price Prediction
RNNs: Recurrent Neural Networks are able to model sequential dependencies, which makes them suitable for financial time series data. However, 
standard RNNs struggle with learning long-term dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem.

LSTM: LSTMs, an advanced version of RNNs, solve this issue via memory cells and gating mechanisms, enabling learning of
both short and long-term trends in price sequences. LSTM is particularly noted for its effectiveness in predicting complex, 
non-linear temporal sequences like stock prices.
